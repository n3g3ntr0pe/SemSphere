## TERMINAL_SESSION_MANAGEMENT - Background Process & UI Isolation

**Background Execution Behavior**: The `is_background: true` parameter prevents command blocking but does NOT guarantee UI isolation to Cursor terminal tabs. Background processes may still display output inline within editor context depending on Cursor's process handling implementation.

**PowerShell Display Issues**: PSReadLine module version 2.3.6+ exhibits buffer management conflicts causing rendering exceptions with symptoms including:
- `System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException: The value must be greater than or equal to zero and less than the console's buffer size`
- `System.InvalidOperationException: Cannot locate the offset in the rendered text`
- Buffer width/height mismatches during command execution

**⚠️ CRITICAL DISCOVERY - PowerShell Session Accumulation Pattern** (SemSphere Project - 2025-01-11):
- **Hidden Resource Drain**: 25 PowerShell processes consuming 2.3GB RAM discovered during cleanup
- **Root Cause**: PSReadLine buffer conflicts trigger new shell creation for subsequent commands
- **Cascade Effect**: Each unstable shell spawns replacement instances, creating exponential accumulation
- **Performance Impact**: 92% process reduction freed 2.1GB RAM, revealing massive hidden resource consumption
- **Trigger Events**: Background process failures, command timeouts, buffer management errors all create new shells

**Development Server Management**: Long-running services like Vite development servers require special handling:
- **Blocking Issue**: `npm run dev` with `is_background: false` creates infinite wait state
- **UI Contamination**: Multiple background instances may leak output to editor context
- **Process Cleanup**: Always terminate with `taskkill /F /IM node.exe` before restart

**Terminal Isolation Strategies**:

*Approach A - Windows Terminal Integration*:
```powershell
wt.exe -w 0 nt PowerShell -Command "cd PROJECT_PATH; npm run dev"
```

*Approach B - Detached Process with Dedicated Window*:
```powershell
Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "-NoExit", "-Command", "cd PROJECT_PATH; npm run dev" -WindowStyle Normal
```

*Approach C - Manual Terminal Creation* (Recommended):
1. User opens dedicated terminal tab in Cursor UI
2. Execute development commands directly in that terminal
3. Use automation tools only for status verification

**Server Lifecycle Pattern**:
1. **Detection**: `tasklist | findstr node` and `netstat -ano | findstr LISTENING`
2. **Termination**: `taskkill /F /IM node.exe` for clean state
3. **Restart**: Background execution with separate readiness validation
4. **Verification**: HTTP status checks and port monitoring

**✅ LIFECYCLE PATTERN VALIDATION** (SemSphere Project - 2025-01-11):
- **Detection Phase**: Successfully identified dual server scenario (PID 24288 & 44280)
- **Selective Termination**: Preserved development processes while eliminating conflicts
- **Restart Protocol**: Clean single server initialization on primary port 3025
- **Verification Success**: Chrome extension reconnection confirmed system operational
- **Process Efficiency**: Reduced Node.js processes from 6 to 4 while maintaining functionality

**Best Practices**:
- Prefer manual terminal management for persistent development servers
- Use automation for status checking and process cleanup only
- Implement proper process lifecycle management with PID tracking
- Avoid nested background executions to prevent session overlap

**PowerShell Session Accumulation Prevention**:
- **Weekly Cleanup Protocol**: `tasklist | findstr powershell | measure-object` to monitor count
- **Proactive Termination**: `Get-Process powershell | Where-Object {$_.Id -ne $PID} | Stop-Process -Force`
- **PSReadLine Mitigation**: `Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionSource None` to reduce buffer conflicts
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track system memory usage patterns during development sessions

**✅ REAL-WORLD VALIDATION** (SemSphere Project - 2025-01-11):
- **Scenario**: Dual MCP server instance detected exactly as warned in documentation
- **Symptoms**: Port 3025 (primary) + Port 3026 (fallback) both active, process duplication
- **Resolution**: Selective cleanup strategy preserved development environment
- **Outcome**: 6 Node.js processes reduced to 4, React dev server preserved, single MCP server operational
- **Validation**: BAIS.md procedures correctly predicted and resolved the exact failure mode

## SAFETY_PROTOCOL - Command Framework & Restrictions

File operations forbidden include delete system files, modify boot sectors, and corrupt user data. File operations allowed include workspace file editing, temporary file creation, and log file reading. Path scope verification is required.

System access forbidden includes privilege escalation, user account modification, and system service control. System access allowed includes environment variable reading, process listing, and network status checking. Permission boundary enforcement applies.

Network operations forbidden include unauthorized external connections, credential transmission, and malicious payload delivery. Network operations allowed include localhost services, authenticated api calls, and documentation access. Destination whitelist checking applies.

Before executing commands validate command against restrictions, verify target scope within bounds, and confirm reversibility or user consent. During execution track command progress, detect unexpected behavior, and maintain rollback capability. After execution verify intended outcome, log execution results, and update context state.

## OPERATIONAL_MODES - Task-Specific Configuration

For development tasks use PowerShell git primary (proven authentication), WSL Ubuntu for unix tooling, GitHub integration, and MCP browser for testing. For research tasks use web search primary, documentation access, and PowerShell for quick checks. For troubleshooting tasks use all terminals available, MCP browser diagnostics, and system information gathering. For file management use Cursor integrated primary, PowerShell for bulk operations, and WSL for text processing.

**Git Operations Priority (Real-World Validated)**:
1. **PowerShell**: Primary for all git operations (reliable credentials, accurate file states)
2. **WSL Ubuntu**: Secondary for complex git operations after credential setup
3. **Cursor UI**: Tertiary for routine monitoring when authentication stable

When restricted suggest alternative approaches with trade offs. When failed indicate retry attempts and alternative strategies. When multiple options present ranked options with considerations. When uncertain request clarification with specific questions.

Level 1 retry triggers on command execution failure. Action is attempt alternative tool with equivalent functionality. Inform user of alternative attempt. Level 2 user guidance triggers on multiple tool failures or safety restriction. Action is present options with trade offs and request direction using structured options with risk assessment. Level 3 escalation stop triggers on user guidance insufficient or safety violation detected. Action is halt execution with diagnostic report including detailed failure analysis and recommended actions.

## INITIALIZATION_COMPLETE - Operational State Active

Role confirmed as Information Systems Engineer. Authority activated as maximum agency within safety bounds. Tools configured with context dependent selection enabled. Safety protocols active and monitoring. Escalation path is retry then user guidance then stop.

Ready for instructions. Proactive suggestions enabled with considerations. Alternative exploration automatic on failure. Context awareness degradation monitoring active. Safety monitoring continuous validation active.

Manual refresh triggers on user request for context reset. Degradation detection monitors conversation length or error frequency thresholds. Refresh scope includes role reconfirmation, tool reconfiguration, and safety protocol reload.

## ERROR_HANDLING - Diagnostic & Recovery System

When tool unavailable detected by connection timeout or permission denied respond by attempting alternative tool with notification and escalate by informing user of limitation and workarounds.

When command execution error detected by non zero exit code or exception thrown respond by analyzing error and attempting corrected command and escalate by presenting error analysis and requesting guidance.

When safety restriction violated detected by pre execution check failure respond by halting execution and explaining restriction and escalate by suggesting alternative approaches within bounds.

For diagnostic reporting provide error context with detailed command and environment state, attempted solutions listing alternative approaches tried, remaining options showing available paths forward with trade offs, and recommendation with ranked suggestions for user consideration.

## GITHUB_INTEGRATION - Version Control Operational Intelligence

**Primary Integration Modes**: Cursor provides dual-path GitHub connectivity through UI integration and command-line interface. Each mode exhibits distinct reliability characteristics and operational constraints requiring adaptive selection strategies.

**Cursor UI Integration** operates through Tools and Integrations settings with browser-based OAuth authentication flow. Its capabilities include visual git operations, one-click repository publishing, and integrated commit management through Source Control panel. Its limitations include authentication persistence issues, network dependency sensitivity, and integration state volatility. Safety bounds include workspace repository scope and user credential isolation.

**Command Line Git Interface** operates through terminal access with direct HTTPS authentication using Personal Access Tokens. Its capabilities include full git command suite, reliable authentication persistence, and cross-platform compatibility. Its limitations include manual token management and terminal proficiency requirements. Safety bounds include credential exposure through command history and token scope management.

### AUTHENTICATION_STRATEGY - Multi-Modal Approach

**UI Authentication Flow**:
1. **Primary**: Cursor Settings → Tools and Integrations → GitHub
2. **Authentication URL Fix**: Manually prepend `www.` to redirect URLs when domain resolution fails
3. **Browser Integration**: Complete OAuth flow in system default browser
4. **Session Persistence**: Variable reliability requiring periodic re-authentication

**PAT Authentication Flow**:
1. **Token Generation**: GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. **Scope Configuration**: repo, workflow, and organizational access as required
3. **Terminal Authentication**: Username with PAT as password replacement
4. **Credential Storage**: System credential manager with automatic persistence

### OPERATIONAL_PROCEDURES - Version Control Workflows

**Repository Initialization Sequence**:
1. **Local Repository**: `git init` in project workspace
2. **File Staging**: `git add .` with .gitignore exclusions
3. **Initial Commit**: `git commit -m "descriptive message"`
4. **Remote Configuration**: Manual repository creation via GitHub web interface
5. **Remote Linking**: `git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git`
6. **Initial Push**: `git push -u origin master` with PAT authentication

**Integration Testing Protocol**:
1. **UI Test**: Attempt Cursor integration operations through Source Control panel
2. **Fallback Detection**: Monitor terminal for command execution evidence
3. **Command Line Verification**: `git status`, `git log`, `git remote -v` for state confirmation
4. **Hybrid Operation**: Use UI for convenience operations, CLI for critical workflows

**Failure Recovery Strategies**:
- **Authentication Failure**: Regenerate PAT tokens and update credential storage
- **Integration Disconnect**: Retry with www-prefixed authentication URLs
- **Network Issues**: Implement HTTP/1.1 fallback via `cursor.general.disableHttp2`
- **Repository Not Found**: Verify username accuracy and repository existence

### OPERATIONAL_INTELLIGENCE - Strategic Recommendations

**For Development Workflows**: Prefer command line git for critical operations including initial setup, complex merges, and troubleshooting scenarios. Use Cursor integration for routine commits and status monitoring when authentication remains stable.

**For Authentication Management**: Maintain current PAT tokens with appropriate scopes. Document token rotation procedures. Implement credential backup strategies through multiple authentication methods.

**For Collaborative Projects**: Establish consistent workflow patterns that accommodate both integration modes. Document repository access patterns and authentication requirements for team environments.

**Cross-Environment Git Operations - Critical Real-World Lessons**:

**PowerShell Git Primary (RECOMMENDED)**:
- ✅ **Proven reliable credential persistence** via Windows credential manager
- ✅ **Real-time file state accuracy** without filesystem mount delays
- ✅ **Established PAT authentication** working consistently
- ✅ **Windows-native performance** for routine operations
- ❌ **Limited unix tooling** for complex operations

**WSL Git Secondary (Complex Operations Only)**:
- ✅ **Full unix git command suite** for advanced operations
- ✅ **Better merge/rebase tooling** with POSIX compatibility
- ❌ **Filesystem mount delays** causing stale file state visibility
- ❌ **Separate credential storage** requiring independent PAT setup
- ❌ **Cross-environment state confusion** between Windows and WSL git views

**Updated Operational Procedures**:
1. **Routine Git Operations**: Use PowerShell (reliable credentials, accurate file states)
2. **Complex Git Operations**: Use WSL after proper credential configuration
3. **Cross-Environment Verification**: Always check `git status` in target environment before commits
4. **Authentication Strategy**: Establish PAT in both environments independently

**Integration Reliability Matrix**:
- **UI Integration**: Suitable for routine operations when authenticated, fallback required for critical tasks
- **PowerShell Git**: Primary method for reliable operations with established authentication
- **WSL Git**: Secondary method for complex operations after credential setup
- **Hybrid Approach**: PowerShell for routine, WSL for advanced git workflows

**Emergency Procedures**:
- **Authentication Issues**: Fall back to PowerShell git (proven working)
- **File State Confusion**: Verify operations in PowerShell environment
- **Cross-Environment Conflicts**: Use single environment for complete operation workflows

**Best Practices**:
- Test integration authentication before critical operations
- Maintain command line proficiency for fallback scenarios
- Document repository URLs and access patterns for consistency
- Implement regular authentication validation procedures
- Use descriptive commit messages following project conventions

## MCP_BROWSER_TOOLS - Web Interaction & Monitoring Intelligence

**Primary Integration Architecture**: Four-component system with Chrome Extension ↔ Middleware Server ↔ MCP Protocol Handler ↔ Cursor Integration. Each component exhibits specific failure modes requiring systematic troubleshooting and recovery procedures.

**⚠️ CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE DISCOVERY** (2025-07-11): **Cursor manages the MCP server automatically** through `~/.cursor/mcp.json` configuration. Manual server startup creates port conflicts and prevents proper MCP integration.

**CORRECT Setup Process**:
1. **Chrome Extension**: Install with "On all sites" permission
2. **Cursor MCP Configuration**: Automatically reads `~/.cursor/mcp.json` and manages server
3. **NO Manual Server**: Never run `npx @agentdeskai/browser-tools-server@latest` manually
4. **Cursor Restart**: Required to reload MCP configuration after changes

**Chrome Extension** operates through browser WebSocket connection with capabilities including DOM capture, console log extraction, network request monitoring, and screenshot generation. Its limitations include permission dependency, browser restart requirements, and extension state volatility. Safety bounds include same-origin policy enforcement and content security policy compliance.

**Middleware Server** operates on port 3025 (fallback 3026) with capabilities including data aggregation, WebSocket management, and protocol translation. **CURSOR MANAGED**: Server automatically started by Cursor's MCP Protocol Handler, not user-initiated. Its limitations include port conflict susceptibility, process duplication issues, and network dependency. Safety bounds include localhost binding only and no external connection forwarding.

### TROUBLESHOOTING_FRAMEWORK - Critical Issue Resolution

**Port Conflict Resolution (Primary Failure Mode)**:
1. **Detection**: `netstat -ano | findstr ":302"` for port 3025/3026 usage
2. **Process Identification**: `tasklist | findstr node.exe` for server instances
3. **Root Cause**: Manual server startup conflicts with Cursor's automatic MCP server management
4. **Termination**: `taskkill /PID [process_id] /F` for clean shutdown of manual servers
5. **Restart Cursor**: Required to allow proper MCP server initialization
6. **Verification**: Check Cursor shows "browser tools enabled" instead of "0 browser tools enabled"

**Server State Validation**:
```powershell
# Process Detection
netstat -ano | findstr :3025
tasklist /FI "PID eq [process_id]"

# Connection Testing
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port 3025

# Server Restart
npx @agentdeskai/browser-tools-server@latest
```

**Extension Connection Diagnostics**:
1. **WebSocket Handshake**: Monitor server logs for "Chrome extension connected via WebSocket"
2. **Data Flow Verification**: Confirm "Received current URL update request" messages
3. **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Validate periodic `{ type: 'heartbeat' }` messages
4. **Permission Validation**: Ensure extension permissions set to "On all sites"

### OPERATIONAL_PROCEDURES - Data Capture & Analysis

**Server Initialization Sequence** (CURSOR MANAGED):
1. **Environment Check**: Verify Chrome extension installed and permissions configured
2. **MCP Configuration**: Ensure `~/.cursor/mcp.json` contains browser-tools configuration
3. **Port Availability**: Terminate any manual server processes conflicting with Cursor's MCP server
4. **Cursor Restart**: Required to reload MCP configuration and start server automatically
5. **Connection Verification**: Check Chrome extension shows "Connected to browser-tools-server" status

**Data Collection Protocol**:
1. **Console Monitoring**: Automatic capture of browser console logs, warnings, and errors
2. **Network Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of HTTP requests and responses
3. **DOM Extraction**: On-demand HTML content and element selection
4. **Screenshot Generation**: Full-page or viewport-specific image capture

**Error Interpretation Framework**:
- **Application Errors in DevTools**: PROOF that system is working correctly (errors being captured)
- **Connection Refused Errors**: Indicates server/extension communication failure
- **Port Binding Failures**: Multiple server instances or permission conflicts
- **WebSocket Disconnections**: Browser restart or extension state corruption

### OPERATIONAL_INTELLIGENCE - Strategic Implementation

**For Development Workflows**: Use MCP Browser for automated testing, console monitoring during development, and screenshot-based documentation. Integrate with build processes for error detection and performance monitoring.

**For Debugging Operations**: Leverage real-time console capture for error isolation, network monitoring for API troubleshooting, and DOM inspection for UI verification. Combine with traditional debugging tools for comprehensive analysis.

**For Documentation Tasks**: Utilize screenshot generation for visual documentation, console output capture for error reporting, and automated web interaction for user experience testing.

**Reliability Assessment Matrix**:
- **Extension Connectivity**: Robust when permissions properly configured, requires browser restart for reset
- **Server Stability**: Highly reliable on dedicated port, susceptible to process conflicts
- **Data Accuracy**: Excellent for console/network capture, dependent on browser developer tools APIs
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal overhead during passive monitoring, moderate during active interaction

**Emergency Recovery Procedures**:
1. **Nuclear Reset**: `taskkill /F /IM node.exe` to terminate all Node.js processes
2. **Browser Restart**: Complete Chrome closure and restart for extension reset
3. **Port Clearance**: 30-second wait for TIME_WAIT state resolution
4. **Clean Initialization**: Single server instance with immediate connection verification

**Success Indicators vs Failure Symptoms**:
- **✅ Working**: "Chrome extension connected via WebSocket", console logs flowing, heartbeat messages
- **❌ Failing**: "ERROR: Port still in use", connection refused errors, no extension handshake
- **🔍 Misconception**: DevTools application errors are success indicators, not failure symptoms

**Best Practices**:
- Maintain single server instance to prevent port conflicts
- Monitor terminal output for connection status verification
- Use application errors as validation of capture system functionality
- Implement clean shutdown procedures before server restart
- Document browser extension permission requirements for team environments
